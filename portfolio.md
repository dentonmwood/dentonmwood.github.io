# Portfolio: Denton Wood

## Overview
I am a software engineer passionate about software infrastructure, good coding practices, and user data safety. My dream is that all software would be designed to help users in the best way possible without misusing their data.

## Works

### Paper: Database-Conscious End-to-End Testing For Reactive Systems Using Containerization (2021)

#### Purpose:

Research paper submitted to the 23rd International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS)

#### Abstract:

Reactive systems are a relatively new paradigm in computer science architecture with important implications for computer science. While much attention has been paid to effectively running end-to-end (E2E) tests on these architectures, little work has considered the implications of tests which modify the database. We propose a framework to group and orchestrate E2E tests based on data qualities across a series of parallel containerized application instances. The framework is designed to run completely independent tests in parallel while being mindful of system costs. We present a conceptual version of the framework and discuss future directions with this work.

### Paper: DDoS Attack Detection Using Latent Dimensions and Clustering (2020)

#### Purpose:

Paper written for CSI 4352 (Data Mining)

#### Abstract:

DDoS attacks have proven to be effective at taking down
massive web targets, giving inordinate power over the
Internet to malicious parties and causing widespread damage.
Effective detection solutions allow companies to identify
incoming attacks and mitigate damage they could cause.
Clustering has been explored for various network anomaly
detection scenarios, but never in conjunction with
dimensionality reduction via autoencoders. We propose using
this approach to identify latent spaces, then using
K-Means++ clustering to provide better cluster detection for
identifying malicious bot flows against normal human
traffic. We test our implementation on the Canadian
Institute for Cybersecurity's DDoS 2019 dataset and evaluate
our results.

### Paper: Tesseract (2020)

#### Purpose:

Paper written for CSI 5388 (Advanced Topics in Human and Computer Interaction).</p>

#### Context:

This course focused on two things: creatively exploring new methods of interacting with computers (VR, AR, gestures, etc.)
and writing a research paper. My final project was to write a complete research paper (with faux results) over a theoretical
interface using one of the new categories we had learned in the course. Tesseract, an interface I designed 
with a friend earlier in the course, is a tangible interface which allows educators and students to quickly set up presentations 
in the classroom by moving authentication to outside of class time. This second iteration of Tesseract features 
a form of tangible 2FA using FIDO's CTAP2 standard over NFC.

### Project: Revamping the Privacy Policy (2019)

#### Purpose:

Thesis written to fulfill requirements for the Honors Program at Baylor University. Advised by [Dr. Jeff Donahoo](http://cs.baylor.edu/~donahoo/)

#### Context:

All students enrolled in the Honors Program at Baylor are required to complete a thesis on a topic which interests them. 
Since before my freshman year began, I had known that I wanted to write on something related to computer ethics. As I started to research during
my junior year, I narrowed my topic to privacy policies and the lack of knowledge surrounding them. The topic affects a large
majority of Americans, and I wanted to help. I caught my "big break", terrible as it was, when the Facebook-Cambridge 
Analytica scandal broke in March 2018. I ran my experiment the following spring and defended my thesis in May 2019.

### Paper: State-Sponsored Hacking (2017)

#### Purpose:

Paper written for PHI 1310 (Computer Ethics) at Baylor University

#### Context:

In Computer Ethics, we were given real-world situations and asked to ethically evaluate them from a chosen side.
The professor emphasized that the side we picked did not matter; we needed to choose one and defend it well.
The prompt for this paper was to analyze whether or not countries should sponsor hacking. I chose to separate the
contexts of wartime and peacetime, arguing that modern warfare necessitates the use of hacking, but antagonistic
peacetime hacking is detrimental to both sides.
